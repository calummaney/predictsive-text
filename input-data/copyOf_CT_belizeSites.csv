iNaturalist,White-tailed Deer,Odocoileus,virgnianus,27/12/2014,An early morning trip to the Gallon Jug Farm from Chan Chich Lodge revealed a good number of White-tailed Deer - Odocoileus virginianus. People don't hunt around the lodge or the farm so the deer are common. Their abundance means there is a lot of prey for big cats. Both Puma and Jaguar have healthy populations in the area.,paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293527999
iNaturalist,Black-cheeked Woodpecker,Melanerpes,pucherani,25/12/2014,"Lovely Chan Chich Lodge. The thing we appreciate most about the place is the network of trails that lead out from the cabana doors into the forest. We spent many hours walking in the woods, never knowing what might be around the next corner. On this trip it was mostly monkeys (Howler and Spider) but on our first visit in 2006 we had a stunning encounter with a Jaguar. This male Black-cheeked Woodpecker - Melanerpes pucherani - was feeding on palm nuts by the main restaurant building. It and two of its buddies were on or around the palm trees most of our stay.",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293532687

iNaturalist,Fringe-lipped Bat,Trachops,cirrhosus,27/12/2014,"Chan Chich is located in northwestern Belize near the Guatemalan border. The lodge is built among the ruins of a Mayan city, including a number of temples and several large pyramids containing the tombs of various rulers. Some years ago, before Chan Chich was established, looters dug deep perpendicular trenches into the pyramids to reach the burial chambers. I carefully entered the deepest of the tombs in search of bats to photograph. As I descended the narrow passage I could make out a number of bats clinging to the back wall. Turning to my head I looked into a side chamber opening to my right. It was full of bats. Startled by the light a number of them flew out brushing close enough that I could feel the air fanned on my face by their flight.",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293530804
iNaturalist,Sowell's Short-tailed Bat,Carollia,sowelli,27/12/2014,"Sharing the Mayan tomb with the Fringe-lipped Bats was a cluster of a much smaller species. As I edged deeper into the side cavern to photograph them, creatures started to stir around me. ",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293528940
iNaturalist,Purple-crowned Fairy,Heliothryx ,barroti,27/12/2014,We had several forest sightings of Purple-crowned Fairy - Heliothryx barroti - on the trails leading out from Chan Chich Lodge,paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293526103
iNaturalist,Sungrebe,Heliornis,fulica,23/12/2014,On our paddle down the Rio Bravo we came across a deep pool which was home to a Sungrebe - Heliornis fulica. In the shade of the forest and slanting late afternoon sun it was tricky to secure any photo of the bird at all. ,paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293525272
iNaturalist,Proboscis Bat,Rhynchonycteris,naso,23/12/2014,On our canoe trip down the Rio Bravo from Chan Chich Lodge we came across a group of superbly camouflaged Proboscis Bats as they clung to the bark of a large tree hanging over the water. ,paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293524964
iNaturalist,Hooded Warbler,Setophager,citrina,23/12/2014,"This one was encountered at an Army Ant swarm near Chan Chich Lodge in western Belize, opportunistically feeding on small insects and spiders fleeing from the hoard. On our long hikes from the lodge we would encounter two or three swarms a day. We found them by watching for atypical bird behaviour - such as a Woodcreeper perched close and unconcerned in the understory or fluttering across the trail at our feet. When we examined such scenes the trails of ants moving through the forest were pretty easy to find",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293524197
iNaturalist,Ruddy Woodcreeper,Dendrocincla,homochroa,24/12/2014,"A couple times a day on our long forest hikes at Chan Chich Lodge we would encounter swarms of army ants and their accompaniment of birds. Although the swarms were not very big - the main mass covering three to six square metres at the most - the swirling carpet of them on the forest floor was still very impressive. Accompanying the ants would be a flock of nine to ten birds; remarkably consistent in composition and behaviour. The group would typically include two or three Gray-headed Tanagers, a family group of Red-throated Ant-Tanagers and three or four woodcreepers of alternating species (Tawny-winged, Ruddy, Olivaceous, Strong-billed and Northern Barred). Sometimes we would see Hooded and Kentucky Warblers joining in as well. The birds would occasionally squabble with one another but mostly they perched intently on the ground or on low saplings above the swarm and made short sallies to pick off insects and spiders fleeing the ants",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293523700
iNaturalist,Tody Motmot,Hylomanes,momotula,25/12/2014,"Smallest and least conspicuous of the motmots, this bird likes to sit low and motionless in the dark understory. Spotted by our guide Raul amongst the Mayan ruins at Laguna Seca near Chan Chich Lodge, Belize.",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293521899
iNaturalist,Northern Schiffornis,Schiffornis,veraepacis,27/12/2014,"Although common at Chan Chich its muted colouration and preference for the understory mean it is seldom seen. The best clue to its presence is its loud song, a slurred melancholy whistled ""Oh where be me feet, Pete?"" This one was singing on the Bajo trail at Chan Chich Lodge. By whistling a poor imitation of its song I was able to bring it close enough to capture a fleeting image. I really love this picture because it presents the bird in its environment just as I imagine it. The only problem is some foreground foliage that has blurred the breast out, but that's the forest for you!",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293521323
iNaturalist,Red-capped Manakin,Ceratopipra,mentalis,28/12/2014,"Manakins are great birds, strange little jewels in the forest. This one was photographed at dawn just off the Sylvester Road at Belize's famous Chan Chich Lodge.",paulbjones,https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/293520341

eBird,Warbling Vireo,Vireo,gilvus,09/10/2015,"I was in an area of what is termed “Broken Ridge” here in Belize, which is a broadleaf forest on granitic soils.

eBird,Garganey/Green-winged Teal,,,11/10/2020,"Because there is no significant open water in these flooded rice fields, we only saw the birds in flight",Louis Peña,https://ebird.org/checklist/S74747459
eBird,Jaeger sp.,,,15/11/2020," It flew along the creek by waterside app. 25 feet above the water - long pointed and dark wings like a gull, with shorter head and neck profile than a gull. Light buff color of head to throat. seemed to have a somewhat darker band below the throat. Dark cap on top of head - long thin black tail. Belly and vent area seemed pale or gray - could have shaded by body and be clearer that it appeared. then I ran past Hokey Pokey landing to get another view and saw it turning left - away from the creek and in over the mangrove. Now seeing it from the back, I could see the center tail feathers protruding beyond the other tail feathers in a pointed shape. All dark on the back except from buff'ish/ neck/head area and a pale on outer part of wings. I got a 3rd and last sight of it, when it came up for a short turn and went back below the mangrove line, but it didn't add any further details of the bird. There seemed to be an open area being dredged across there and we heard a machine working.",Jes Christian Bech,https://ebird.org/checklist/S76309611
